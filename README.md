- So for some reason I deleted my previous README.md file, so thats a bummer. Anyway, I believe I uploaded my final version. Read the rubric closely this time
  realized that I was suppose to put css and html files in their respected folders. So I did that and the links broke, so I had to fix that with the "../".

- Interesting experincing developing a webpage. Very different from what I am usually assigned from my previous coding classes. I'd say it was fun cause I felt like I was actually
  building something.
